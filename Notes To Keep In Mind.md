The Raspberry Pi 5 reccomends a power source of 5V 5A. I do not currently have this available so the FLIR is powered by a mobile battery pack until solved.

The Output/Input of the RPI through Lightbridge 2 is not perfect. I am working on a fix but for now I reccomend running the scripts before launch.

When Printing the parts, Make sure the FLIR GIMBAL and FLIR GIMBAL ARM have not warped when printing. This can cause issues with balancing and RPI/Buck Converter security.

Look out for interference of the parts and wires when and after install. You don't want to have the cables disconnect when in the air or issues with the Power Cables.

The current servo connecting to the FLIR GIMBAL part has some play. That will be fixed in an updated model.

Please keep in mind this is not a professional or perfect setup. I have created this project out of Fun and Interest.
